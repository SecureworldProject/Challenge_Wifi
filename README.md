# Challenge_Wifi

This challenge checks if a device is located within the Wifi network. The challenge returns the 'MAC' address of the target device if it is in the network and 0000 otherwise.

This enables parental control. For example, it allows to know if the father smartphone and child devices are in the same network.

It uses `getmac` library, which can be installed with `pip install getmac`
